 In this paper, constrained optimal control of a current source rectifier (CSR) is presented, based on a mathematical model developed in Park's frame. To comply with the system constraints an explicit model-based predictive controller was established. To simplify the control design, a disjointed model was utilised due to the significant time constant differences between the AC and DC side dynamics. As a result, active damping was used on the AC side, and explicit Model Predictive Control (MPC) on the DC side. The results are compared by simulation with the performance of a state feedback control.
