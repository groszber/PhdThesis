First the networks structure shall be described, the power electrical system is connected to, as a household supplying, renewable utilizing device. Then a control cost-function candidate, the proposed geometrical approach shall be presented, as an indicator of voltage unbalance.

\section{Network structure}\label{VUB:sec:Network}

         The examined network is supposed to be the low voltage local transformer area with regular households, depicted in Figure \ref{fig:network}. The network structure of Figure \ref{fig:network} has been implemented in Simulink\texttrademark\, environment for simulation based experiments. Most of the households represent a single phase load with resistive inductive and capacitive properties while some of them are symmetric three phase ones. There might also be some households with domestic power plant, they are not only loads but also represents distributed generators. Furthermore, it is assumed that the households located on a domestic size grid tie inverter are also provided with battery storage capacities. Commercially available inverters are capable of optimizing the working point and charging current of the system, while the ability of power quality improvement is far not typical - it is in experimental phase in some cases, e.g. \cite{gorbe2012reduction}.%

The transformer and the loads are connected with power line sections infected by inductive and resistive disturbances and capacitive couplings. Domestic powerplants can connect to any connection point within the low voltage network, via an appropriate inverter - either to the three phase sections using a three phase inverter or to a single phase using a single phase inverter.}

\section{Proposed geometrical indicator}\label{VUB:sec:Geom}

    As discussed in section \ref{BASICUNB:sec:DefinitionsofUNB}, the indicators of voltage unbalance result very different measures for the same circumstance. Additionally most of them neglecting the phase differences of voltage vectors compared to the ideal, and even the currently used $VUF$ calculated by \ref{BASICUNB:equ:VUF} is not taking zero sequence components from the Foresque method \cite{fortescue1918method}. There were attepts to close the gap with the CVUF norm shown in \ref{BASICUNB:equ:CVUF}, where the complex component is also considered, but this makes this a clumsy candidate for control design, since two components (real and complex part) shall weighted and applied. This begs the question, how could voltage unbalance be measured loss-less, but resulting one (conveniently quadratic-like) value, easyli applicable for minimization algorithm \\
		Hence can be stated that every difference between the ideal and the measured voltage in both amplitude phase and sub-harmonics causing a form of voltage deviation. The problem can also be investigated from a geometrical point of view as it is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:threephase}. The three-phase voltage system's phasor diagram contains three  phase-to-neutral voltage vectors which can be regarded as the points of a triangle (similarly, the three line-to-line vectors can play the role of the edges of the triangle). The two triangles (i.e. the ideal and the actual ones) always intersect except from very extreme and physically meaningless cases. The area where the two triangles do not cover each other (i.e. the difference of their union and intersection) can be used as a norm of voltage quality. In fact it is computationally more demanding compared to the previous methods, but takes every deviation into consideration \cite{Neukirchner2015},\cite{neukirchner2015examination}. The calculation of error is given by (\ref{equ:geom}).

            \begin{equation}
                \begin{array}{rcl}
                       G&=&\textnormal{Area of }(\bigtriangleup_{Ideal}\cup\bigtriangleup_{Real}-\bigtriangleup_{Ideal}\cap\bigtriangleup_{Real}),
                \end{array}
                \label{equ:geom}
            \end{equation}

            $\bigtriangleup_{Ideal}$ indicates the triangle spanned by the ideal voltage vectors and $\bigtriangleup_{Real}$ the triangle of real voltage vectors. Difference of the ideal and the real triangle's union and intersection defines the norm $G$. Basically, the algorithm calculates the symmetrical difference of the triangles, stretched from three phase ideal and real voltage vectors.

\section{The method's novelty compared to VUF}\label{VUB:sec:AdditionalContent}

When using a new method for calculation and cost function it is reasonable to test it's usability against the prevalent or regulated method the voltage unbalance factor ($VUF$) defined by the International Electrotechnical Commission, as discussed in section \ref{BASICUNB:sec:VUFCVUF}. In this case the geometrical norm's utility (\ref{equ:geom}) against the $VUF$ (\ref{equ:regular}) value shall be examined. \\
The geometrical norm was validated experimentally, by investigating the correlation between the regulated (\ref{equ:regular})  and geometrical (\ref{equ:geom}) norms subjected to random, uniformly distributed unbalance on the voltage vector amplitude and phase values with $20$ V amplitude and $1/300\cdot\pi$ rad phase variance (Fig. \ref{fig:correlation}, and Fig. \ref{fig:side_correlation}).

            \begin{figure}[!ht]
           \centering
           \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,scale=0.95]{Unblance_EPS_Pics/EPS_images/scatter.eps}
           \caption{Correlation between the geometrical voltage unbalance indicator $G$ and the regulated voltage unbalance indicator $VUF$ using 1000 samples. In every iteration each three phase voltage vector's amplitude and phase values changed randomly, according to uniform distributions with $\pm20$ V and $\pm\frac{1}{3}\pi\cdot10^{-2}$ rad variance. It can be seen, that the geometric norm contains more information than the classical one. The  four asymmetry cases of Figure \ref{fig:cases} are denoted by black symbols on the picture. It is apparent, that in case (c), and (d) the G norm holds additional information than the $VUF$.}
           \label{fig:correlation}
            \end{figure}

            \begin{figure}[!ht]
           \centering
           \includegraphics[width=\textwidth,scale=0.95]{Unblance_EPS_Pics/EPS_images/side_scatter.eps}
           \caption{ Correlation between the regulated unbalance indicator and the fraction of geometrical and regulated indicator. It can be seen that there is a functional connection between the two values.}
           \label{fig:side_correlation}
            \end{figure}


            Although there is correlation between the two norm values in the general case, but for some situations the regular method indicates low, while geometrical norm still indicates high value.\\
            On Figure \ref{fig:cases_A} dominant phase deviation can be observed, while Figure \ref{fig:cases_B} shows amplitude deviation but with opposite direction. When there is such deviation on the grid both indicators present almost identical results. On \ref{fig:cases_C} there is still observable unbalance (two phase deviate stronger than the third in terms of amplitude), but the correlation is significantly lower. In the last case in the lowest correlation area, amplitude deviation is present, but the deviation direction is identical on all phases (balanced over-voltage or under-voltage)(Figure \ref{fig:cases_D}). The regular method indicates very low values. In this case other methods are utilised in parallel in terms of network diagnostics to detect the under-voltage phenomena.\cite{arn1997under-voltage}.

            \end{figure}

To clarify this, the regular norm's calculation method needs to be investigated. The symmetrical component mutual impedance matrix on a three phase connection point is given by (\ref{equ:mutual}),

            \begin{equation}
                \begin{array}{rcl}
                       Z_s&=&\frac{1}{3}\begin{bmatrix} 1&1&1\\1&\alpha&\alpha^2\\1&\alpha^2&\alpha \end{bmatrix}\cdot
                                        \begin{bmatrix} Z_{aa}&Z_{ab}&Z_{ac}\\Z_{ba}&Z_{bb}&Z_{bc}\\Z_{ca}&Z_{cb}&Z_{cc} \end{bmatrix}\cdot
                                        \begin{bmatrix} 1&1&1\\1&\alpha^2&\alpha\\1&\alpha&\alpha^2\end{bmatrix}=\\
                          &=&  \begin{bmatrix} Z_{00}&Z_{01}&Z_{02}\\Z_{10}&Z_{11}&Z_{12}\\Z_{20}&Z_{21}&Z_{22} \end{bmatrix},

                \end{array}
                \label{equ:mutual}
            \end{equation}

where $Z_s$ is the symmetrical component mutual impedance matrix, and $\alpha=e^{j\frac{2}{3}\pi}$. If there are both negative and zero sequence symmetrical components present on the network, the dominant part of the voltage drop's negative and zero sequence can be calculated as follows (\ref{equ:drop}).

            \begin{equation}
                \begin{array}{rcl}
                       \Delta U_2&\approx&Z_{21}I_1+Z_{22}I_2\\
                       \Delta U_0&\approx&Z_{01}I_1+Z_{00}I_0,
                \end{array}
                \label{equ:drop}
            \end{equation}

$\Delta U_0,\,\Delta U_1,\,\Delta U_2$ are the voltage drop's zero positive and negative sequence components, $I_0,\,I_1,\,I_2$ are the current's drop's zero positive and negative sequence components, and $Z_{00},Z_{01},\,Z_{21},\,Z_{22}$ are mutual impedances,  respectively. (If there is only positive and negative sequence present, then the right hand side's second term is zero.) As such, the indication of negative and zero sequence present the network calculates (\ref{equ:factor}):

            \begin{equation}
                \begin{array}{rcl}
                       m_{21}&=&\mid\frac{Z_{21}}{Z_{11}}\mid\times100\\
                       m_{01}&=&\mid\frac{Z_{01}}{Z_{11}}\mid\times100,
                \end{array}
                \label{equ:factor}
            \end{equation}

where $m_{21}$ is the negative sequence factor which is identical to the VUF (\ref{equ:regular}), and $m_{01}$ is the zero sequence factor.\\
At the previously described balanced over- or under-voltage case the positive sequence value is dominant, so the regular indicator will take considerably lower value. In other words, aside from indicating voltage unbalance, the geometrical method incorporates the balanced deviations as well. In a control design perspective, a general case, where notably highly unbalance values may appear, using $VUF$ as cost function could introduce hidden errors in control due error cancellation. Additionally the geometrical solution checks electrical asymmetry, i.e. the norm of a $\pm120$ degree rotated version of the ideal three-phase phasor is zero in the geometrical sense. Moreover, the geometrical norm is more sensitive for small scale unbalance, as opposed to the VUF. To summarize, the geometrical indicator a more suitable solution for a more general case indicator, and a good candidate for cost function in optimal control design.

\section{Unbalance compensation}\label{VUB:sec:Compensation}

Based on the proposed measures on voltage unbalance indication, it is possible to formulate some power quality related aims, or demands for the domestic size generator units implemented in a complex power electrical system, capable of supplying a household, with both renewable and network supplied energy, and lowering voltage unbalance as well.

\subsection{Problem statement}\label{VUB:sec:Statement}

    The voltage and current unbalance presents in the three phase low voltage transformer area causes additional power loss inside the medium voltage/low voltage transformer and in the transportation line wires too. It also has undesired effects in certain three phase loads, mainly rotating machines where it causes torque reduction and pulsating torque effect. Large scale unbalance can activate automatic protection functions of electricity dispatch system causes power outage. This is unpleasant for the customers and adds maintenance cost to the service provider. These negative effects lower the electric power quality and rises the cost of electrical energy and rises the carbon footprint of our everyday life. The paper's aim to propose a model and control for a three phase instrumentation, which can compensate these undesirable effects, lower or eliminate the voltage and current unbalance to lower the power losses and the CO${}_2$ emission and increase power quality not only at the connection point but in the whole low voltage transformer area. \emph{It is important to note, that this power quality improvement can be achieved without any significant added cost.} The future aim is to integrate this function into an existing three phase photovoltaic inverter device connected to the low voltage grid, and a  complex energetic system is able to inject the renewable energy to the transportation network, can store the electrical energy from stochastic renewable sources in electrical vehicle batteries or feed the grid from the charged batteries in energy deficit and high demand simultaneous situations. Our new added value is the integrated control algorithm which can highly lower or eliminate the observed unbalance of the network.

    \subsection{Control problem}\label{VUB:sec:Control}

    The above problem statement partially specifies the solution space together with the solution method. The system of interest is the power grid with all the stochastic and nonlinear phenomena present in it mentioned in section \ref{VUB:sec:Network}. The input to the system are current signals (one current in the single phase case and three in the three phase setup), which are naturally constrained by the available energy of the household, stored in a battery pack or momentarily generated by the wind or solar generator unit. The response of the system can be either the current or the voltage measured at the connection point of the inverter unit, however, the general legal regulations only allow voltage measurement for consumers. The difficulty of the control problem comes from the fact, that there are no mathematically tractable models of the network can be generated because of its unpredictable and nonlinear features. This means, that in these therms only black-box methods can be applied for this system.
For the control aim it is a natural choice to minimize the actual voltage unbalance of the low voltage local transformer area measured (or calculated) at the connection point of the inverter. Several optimization based methods are available for such kind of optimal control problems, e.g. \cite{gorbe2012reduction} where the only bottleneck is the computational efficiency since the implemented controller has to run on the commercial inverter's hardware (digital signal processor unit).

    \subsubsection{Asymmetrical inverter structure}\label{VUB:sec:Inverter}

    For the sake of completeness an asymmetrical inverter was developed in simulation environment, which is capable of carrying out the specified control task. The renewable energy injection is realized increasingly, and applied directly to the three phase low voltage grid  with a domestic size photovoltaic power plant as source of power. This can reduce the voltage and current unbalance caused by the stochastic power production of wind and solar sources. More and more manufacturers produce three phase grid synchronized inverters from 5\,kW size. These equipments implement accurate symmetrical current feed with a standard three phase full bridge structure, consists of six Isolated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT). The demand is to employ a current source single phase structure with aforementioned controllable switches in section \ref{BASICCSR:sec:CSI}. This is a standard structure suitable for symmetric harmonic current injection. It has limited capacities to inject not totally symmetric 3 phase current time functions, but Kirchhoff's current law permits only constant zero-sum current time functions injected with this structure. There are examples with this type of asymmetric current injections in the literature \cite{lee2009new}.\\
    This type of current injections has limited compensation capacity and this is not enough in most asymmetric production and load cases. In our case we need more general, not specific asymmetric current waveforms, because the proposed control aim assumes the ability of injecting non zero-sum currents. This needs special inverter design structure. We need zero line connection for the differential current. One of the possible solution is to use 3 different full bridge single phase current inverters to supply each phase of low voltage transportation lines \cite{Patnaik2013topologies}. This way it is most sufficient to use bi-directional power flow, with galvanic decoupling, but with a current controlled fashion (shown in section \ref{BASICCSR:sec:CSI}).\\
    This isolation can be reached  with using isolation transformers in the supply side. But we prefer to use it a complex energetic system with specific inside true DC bus system fed from Photovoltaic panel or batteries. We have to isolate at least 2 full bridges with two way DC-DC converters (described in section \label{BASICCSR:sec:DCDC}). This can complicate the physical realization but easy to simulate with two controlled power source. Other possible easy to realize solution to isolate the full bridge outputs  connected to three phase lines with isolating transformers. It is recommended due to electric shock protection reasons. Our distant aim to compensate other operational type line failures, such zero current appearing. This isolation method doesn't allow to produce DC current components, thats why we are looking for other design. Possible elegant solution to supplement the standard three phase inverter design with a fourth half bridge for Zero line, building a specific four leg inverter design \cite{Ninad2014control}.\\
    Only drawback of this solution is the complex difficult control method of the half bridges, to keep the current sum in zero values in each moment, and to provide the correct current paths inside the inverter. This structure has the lowest production cost, but in the phase of proofing the asymmetry compensation we chose the DC-DC isolated  full bridge design for simulation purpose because of the simple control during simulation.\\
    As a further generalization step, the injection of no harmonic current shapes will be necessary in order to decrease the extant Total Harmonic Distortion (THD) of the network. These expectations yield an inverter with new structure suitable for arbitrary current injections without limitations. The design lends similar elements like in \cite{gorbe2012reduction} by means of battery charge, renewable power point tracking, intermediate voltage, and IGBT bridge control, but in this case the problem requires a three phase solution for the voltage unbalance reduction. The applied structure based on a full bridge IGBT structure used in single phase current injection. Three different IGBT full bridge were connected at the output point, thus our structure has three phase and neutral connection too, to carry out any current form. The disadvantage of this structure is that it needs 12 IGBTs in the output stage as opposed to the 6 IGBTs needed for a classical full bridge structure and needs three galvanically isolated direct current (DC) voltage source for feeding.\\
    The other standard elements, that the inverter design consists:

        \begin{itemize}
            \item Standard maximum power point tracking (MPPT) input stage, to inject the maximum available power from the renewable source to the intermediate voltage capacitor with a simple controlled boost converter
            \item A half bridge current controller to charge or deploy the battery pack connected to the complex energetic system for energy storage and energy unbalance compensation
            \item Intermediate voltage controller
            \item Universal three phase output stage with 3 single phase full bridge IGBT current injector and 2 high current DC-DC converter
        \end{itemize}
    This is suitable to inject any necessary current shape to the low voltage three phase grid connection even DC currents too. Later a power loss and production cost analysis will be necessary if the built structure will be suitable for asymmetric compensation of low voltage transformer area.

        Of course there is a possibility that there is no renewable power available for a longer period of time and the battery completely looses its charge. In this case the system should work merely with the power of the connection point but with zero energy balance. This states to operate two controller with semi-opposite control goals. The optimization based controller requires current injection while the intermediate voltage controller (Figure \ref{fig:inv}) keeps the inverters energy balance. Although for this operation some of the control's performance should be sacrificed, unbalance compensation could be achieved even without external renewable power, and energy storage at a minimum power requirement.

        \subsubsection{Measurements from a real unbalanced network}\label{VUB:sec:Measurement}

            The measurements took place at the Faculty's building, where a common 400\,V connection point was investigated as the behaviour of the network. The three phase 230\,V line-to-ground voltages has been transformed to 6\,V to be effectively measurable time domain with high performance NI-USB DAQ on 10\,ksample/s. Because of the limited computational capacity only a 10 second measurement was made in every hour.  The measurements then has been merged and smoothed to eliminate the inter-measurement transients.\\
            Afterwards, the measurement data has been used as the input of a micro-grid segment of the Matlab/Simulink model, to test the controller and inverters structure's performance in quasi-realistic circumstances. The controllers performance on the simulated microgrid's network loss reduction can be observed on Figure \ref{fig:compare_power} and Figure \ref{fig:u_inter}. The measurement output is connected to a modeled three phase load and network system, consisting of symmetrical loads and network segments between them. Further artificial load unbalance is not necessary since the network's unbalance is already present. This structure enables to show that any point the inverter is connected could serve as quality restoration such unbalance compensation at this case. Our future plan is to set up multiple devices on different connection points.

    \subsection{Optimization based control algorithm}\label{VUB:sec:Optimization}

        \begin{figure*}[ht]
        \centering
        \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{Unblance_EPS_Pics/APPS_1_2_.eps}
        \caption{The optimization algorithm implemented for current control. A one dimensional linear optimization step is being solved in each dimension of the six dimensional parameter space, iteratively.}
        \label{fig:APPS}
        \end{figure*}

        The problem is that, the exact mathematical relation is nonlinear because the nonlinear, and highly time variant loads of the network, we should use a control strategy to cope this nonlinear and time variant energy system. For this purpose we chose an asynchronous parallel pattern search method (APPS) which could be able to control our scenario \cite{hough2001asynchronous}. The methodology and formulation of the APPS method is described in section \ref{BASICUNB:sec:APPS}. We applied a variant of the gradient method that is a first-order optimization (minimization) algorithm for a multivariate function $f(\textbf{x})$. The point $\textbf{x}^q$ corresponding to the local minimum can be calculated from the negative gradient $\nabla f(\textbf{x})$, that gives the value and direction of the corresponding step in the parameter space. The next step is made in the direction of gradient with the proper sign. This sequence of steps, ideally, converges to local multivariate extreme value $\textbf{x}^q$ of the function (\ref{eqn:contstruct1}).

        \begin{equation}
        \begin{array}{rcl}
        \label{eqn:contstruct1}
         \textbf{x}^{(q)}&=&\textbf{x}^{(q-1)}-t_q\nabla f(\textbf{x}^{(q-1)}),\\
         %q&\in&\mathbb{N},\\
         \end{array}
        \end{equation}

        where $q\in\mathbb{N}$, and $t_q$ resembles the step time of the algorithm. The controlled electrical system is described by multivariate non-linear differential equations, the optimization of which is infeasible to derive using the differentiation of an error function. Therefore, the optimization methods based on direct differentiation are not applicable. In such cases, when high computational power is needed for performing long time-consuming simulations, the APPS method can utilized. The search pattern $p$ is based on the sampling of the error function (selected norm) on a "grid", and it corresponds to variables or subsets of variables in each point in the independent variable or parameter space easily. At the same time, the norm values at these points can be calculated independently if $\Delta_q>0$, using (\ref{eqn:contstruct2}).
				
        \begin{equation}
        \label{eqn:contstruct2}
        \begin{array}{rcl}
         \textbf{x}^{(q+1)}&=&\textbf{x}^{(q)}+\Delta_qd_i \\
         \mathrm{if}&&f(\textbf{x}^{(k)}+\Delta_qd_i) \leq f(\textbf{x}^{(q)}),\\
         %q&\in&\mathbb{N}\\
         \end{array}
        \end{equation}

        The parameter is $\textbf{x}^q\in\mathbb{R}^n$, and the search pattern $p\in\mathcal{D}={d_1,...d_n}$ is taken from a predefined finite set. In this case, the error function values should be calculated for each pattern $p$ in the set $\mathcal{D}$. If the error function is not decreasing in any of the directions, then the step size should be reduced (e.g. by half). As the competing directions are different, if there is not enough computing power available for direction vector $p$, synchronization should not be maintained. In this case we are talking about the asynchronous case . In the case of our controller, an individual $p$ vector is defined for each output variable, and the optimization was performed in each direction asynchronously and shifted in time. Most likely, the error function has a single local minimum as a symmetric amplitude and phase values. Approaching the minimal value of norm, the controller uses adaptive increments that are proportional to the norm itself. Because of the complex interactions between the components of the controller, only one parameter is changed at a time, even if the values of the amplitude and phase components in specific time slot changes. The algorithm moves along the six axes of six separate time slots close to the local minimum of the error function.\\
        Unlike other similar approaches, e.g. \cite{segui2007approach}, the explained optimal controller does not rely on a measured current signal (which varies according where the measurement took place on the grid and renders the global optimization unreliable) but rather measuring and analyzing the voltage unbalance via the proposed indicator and optimizes the voltage shape, the latter of which depends on the nonlinear distortion of the whole low-voltage transformer area and determines additional power losses. The controller's performance was compared to a non compensated network, and a network consisting synchronized symmetric power intake from a regular inverter.\\
        In each iteration only one physical value is changing on the six dimensional parameter field, which consists of the three amplitude and three phase values. If the change effects with cost function reduction (the reference norm's normalized value), the controller holds the new value of amplitude or phase for the controlled current sources (Figure \ref{fig:APPS}). The advantage of this controller structure that is not necessary to know the controlled value's behavior well, like we could not determine the number and type of the other loads on the network \cite{Neukirchner2015}. There are however two disadvantages. First is the low speed of control, due to the several necessary iterations (depending on the circumstances) to find the optimal directions in the parameter space, and the serial nature of interventions and norm calculations. The second comes from the method itself since the controller may stuck in local minima.

\section{Discussion}\label{VUB:sec:Discussion}

%write stuff here..

    \subsection{Dynamical simulation based experiments}\label{VUB:sec:Results}
		
		\textbf{Simulation's PC parametes, ML/Simuling version}\\
\\
    In order to be able to investigate the proposed optimization based unbalance reduction control structure with the three phase inverter on a low voltage local grid, all the elements of this complex electrical system (including the photovoltaic source, the inverter, the battery and the nonlinear local grid with different types of loads) has been modeled in Matlab/Simulink environment. The primary aim of the simulation based experiments were to serve as a proof of concept for the proposed complex control structure.

    \subsection{Performance analysis}\label{VUB:sec:Performance}

    The aim of performance analysis is twofold. First of all, the proposed voltage unbalance indicator has to be investigated in the control structure as the cost function of the optimization based controller, and on the other hand, the control structure itself has to be exposed against engineering expectations.


            The results of the first experiment can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:compare_asym_PV} where the geometrical norm \ref{equ:geom} has been used as the voltage unbalance indicator and the cost function for the optimizer.  The dashed line represents the examined low voltage local network's unbalance norm ($G$) without the proposed controller implemented in the inverter unit of the domestic powerplant while the solid line represents the compensated network's norm value. The performance of the controller with this norm is apparent, it was able to decrease the network voltage unbalance by approximately 85 \%. In this experimental setup the controller has enough input energy due to the batteries and the available solar power.

            \begin{figure*}[ht]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{Unblance_EPS_Pics/UnbalRedComp_JCP-figure3.eps}
            \caption{Unbalance reduction control system performance with half charged battery and photovoltaic power source available. The underlying unbalance norm is the geometrical one ($G$) in this experiment. After starting the controller at $t=0.1s$ the unbalance measure $G$ of the network significantly decrease.}
            \label{fig:compare_asym_PV}
            \end{figure*}

            \begin{figure*}[ht]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{Unblance_EPS_Pics/UnbalRedComp_JCP-figure4.eps}
            \caption{Unbalance reduction control system performance without battery and renewable source (zero energy balance operation). The performance reduction is clearly observable compared to the case when external power source is available (Figure \ref{fig:compare_asym_PV}), but as result the voltage unbalance indicator $G$ reduced by the average value of 14.78\%.}
            \label{fig:compare_asym}
            \end{figure*}

            A slightly more challenging situation is investigated in Figure \ref{fig:compare_asym} where the controller had had to operate without photovoltaic source and batteries. This is called zero balance operation mode when the energy obtained from the network is reinjected in such a way that the unbalance indicators decrease. It can be seen that the performance of the controller is modest than that of Figure \ref{fig:compare_asym_PV}, but it is still acceptable.

      \subsubsection{Robustness analysis}\label{VUB:sec:Robustness}

            The robustness of the proposed control structure is an important qualitative property with respect to the time dependent loads present on the network. The robustness of the proposed controller had to be tested via simulation when different types of loads (inductive, capacitive, resistive) had been varied in step changes representing representing the on/off switching the different types of household appliances (motors, switching mode power supplies, electric heaters, etc.). In the experiment depicted in Figure \ref{fig:robustness}, a load change has been introduced to the network in every 15 seconds causing the voltage unbalance to jump to a different value (measured in the geometrical norm (\ref{equ:geom})). As it can be seen in the figure the controller successfully compensates the unbalance after each transient.

              \begin{figure*}[ht]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{Unblance_EPS_Pics/UnbalRedComp_JCP-figure5.eps}
            \caption{Robustness analysis with respect to step type changes in the network load (and voltage unbalance). The unbalance reduction controller successfully compensates the changes in the network voltage unbalance norm ($G$) value.}
            \label{fig:robustness}
            \end{figure*}

    \subsection{Environmental effect}\label{VUB:sec:Environment}

    The favorable effects of the proposed unbalance reduction control algorithm , i.e. increase power quality not only at the connection point but in the whole low voltage transformer area, which causes a reduction of the effective power loss and the reduction in the CO${}_2$ emission.

        \subsubsection{Power loss reduction on the network}\label{VUB:sec:Powerloss}

             Network loss reduction due to the unbalance reduction compensation control is investigated on Figure \ref{fig:compare_power} where the simulation experiment was carried out in the circumstance when the renewable source was not shut down (e.g. insufficient amount of sunlight) and additionally the battery was drained completely  \cite{Neukirchner2015}, \cite{neukirchner2015examination}.

            \begin{figure*}[ht]
            \centering
            \includegraphics[width=0.95\textwidth]{Unblance_EPS_Pics/UnbalRedComp_JCP-figure6.eps}
            \caption{Compensation control's loss reduction during zero energy balance operation on the modeled network, where $P_{loss}$ indicates the effective power losses and $P^{comp}_{loss}$ effective power losses during control of the network. As result the network losses reduced by mean $6.5\%$.}
            \label{fig:compare_power}
            \end{figure*}

            The results show that despite of the negative cross effects of the intermediate voltage controller and the unbalance reduction controller it was possible to find the trade-off between the control goals of the different controllers (maintain zero energy balance for the inverter and decrease the unbalance on the network). The estimated loss reduction in the experimental setup is 6.5\%.

        \subsubsection[CO2 footprint]{CO$_2$ footprint}\label{VUB:sec:CO2}

            The fact that this controller enables the reactive power reduction has a favourable consequence, i.e. the power loss or equivalently CO$_2$ emission and the carbon footprint can also be decreased. The estimated environmental effects of voltage asymmetry compensation can be calculated. Let us assume 3000\,kWh for the yearly electric energy consumption an average household and $9.173\%$ for the loss of the distribution network at 2013 \cite{MVM2013} and $7.654\%$ at 2018 \cite{MVM2018}. With the controller the losses on the simulated network are reduced by 6.5\%. The calculation follows (\ref{eqn:co_emission})

            \begin{equation}
                \label{eqn:co_emission}
                \begin{array}{rcl}
                 P_{loss}&=&3000\,\textnormal{kWh}\cdot7.654\%\\
                P^{comp}_{loss}&=&3000\,\textnormal{kWh}\cdot(7.654\cdot0.93)\%\\
                 \Delta P_{loss}&=&P_{loss}-P^{comp}_{loss}\\
                 \end{array}
                \end{equation}

            where $P_{loss}$ is the assumed network loss per household and $P^{comp}_{loss}$ is s the assumed network loss with unbalance compensation control and $\Delta P_{loss}$ is the saved energy. According to (\ref{eqn:co_emission}), unbalance compensation results in an energy savings of 19.26 kWh in 2013 and 16.07 kWh in 2018. Taking into account the proportion of power currently generated by fossil fuels (coal 17.3\%, gas 38.3\% at 2013 \cite{MVM2013}, \cite{gorbe2012reduction} and coal 13.1\%, gas 51.4\% at 2018 \cite{MVM2018}) and the rate of $\textnormal{CO}_2$ emission during electric energy production (1,000\,g/kWh from coal and 430\,g/kWh from gas), it can be concluded that voltage unbalance compensation could reduce $\textnormal{CO}_2$ emissions by 6504.9\,g a year in 2013 and 5656.96\,g in 2018 in an average household. Note that this result reflect only the proof of concept, due the neglected power losses of the inverter and the artificial load of the network.

\section{Conclusion}\label{VUB:sec:Conclusion}

    Currently used measures of voltage unbalance (see section \ref{BASICUNB:sec:DefinitionsofUNB}) has been extended in this work with a new norm candidate, namely a geometrical norm, where the magnitude of voltage unbalance are evaluatad by the symmetrical difference of the voltge phasor triangles. It is more demanding from the computational point, of view but has an interesting feature namely it checks electrical asymmetry, i.e. the norm of a $\pm120$ degree  rotated version of the ideal three-phase phasor is zero in the geometrical sense.\\
    This way, the defined norm is applied as a cost function in the asymmetry reducing controller structure utilizing an asynchronous parallel pattern search (APPS) algorithm also presented in the thesis. Simulations, performed in Matlab/Simulink environment show that the geometrical based indicator can serve as a basis of further research. The suggested controller structure enables the residential users owning a grid synchronized domestic power (renewable) plant to reduce voltage unbalance measurable at the connection point. The fundamental element of the system is a modified three phase inverter that is capable of the asymmetric current injection of any current waveforms to the network, via decoupled bi-diectional DC-DC converters. The optimization based control algorithm injects the available energy (as current waveform) in such a way, that the voltage unbalance decreases. This is an optimization problem which is constrained by the available renewable energy supplied by the power plant.\\
    The control structure has been tested on a low voltage network model in a dynamical simulation environment consisting of the models of the electrical grid, a domestic power plant, an asymmetrical inverter circuit, and different types of loads. Different simulation experiments has been run for each norm and for both the power constrained and unconstrained case. The preliminary results show that this structure can serve as a residential level voltage quality improvement method for the three phase low voltage network also indirectly reduces the CO${}_2$ emission due facilitating more effective energy usage.

%\section{Voltage unbalance compensation with optimization based control algorithm and asymmetrical inverter structure}
%
%    Based on the proposed measures of voltage unbalance it is possible to formulate some power quality related aims, or demands for the domestic size generator units as follows.
%
%    \subsection{Problem statement}
%
%    The voltage and current unbalance presents in the three phase low voltage transformer area causes additional power loss inside the medium voltage/low voltage transformer and in the transportation line wires too. It also has undesired effects in certain three phase loads, mainly rotating machines where it causes torque reduction and pulsating torque effect. Large scale unbalance can activate automatic protection functions of electricity dispatch system causes power outage. This is unpleasant for the customers and adds maintenance cost to the service provider. These negative effects lower the electric power quality and rises the cost of electrical energy and rises the carbon footprint of our everyday life. Our aim to develop a three phase instrumentation, which can compensate these undesirable effects, lower or eliminate the voltage and current unbalance to lower the power losses and the CO${}_2$ emission and increase power quality not only at the connection point but in the whole low voltage transformer area. \emph{It is important to note, that this power quality improvement can be achieved without any significant added cost.} The aim is to integrate this function into an existing three phase photovoltaic inverter device connected to the low voltage grid, and the created complex energetic system is able to inject the renewable energy to the transportation network, can store the electrical energy from stochastic renewable sources in electrical vehicle batteries or feed the grid from the charged batteries in energy deficit and high demand simultaneous situations. Our new added value the integrated control algorithm which can highly lower or eliminate the observed unbalance of the network.
%
%    \subsection{Control problem}
%
%    The above problem statement partially specifies the solution space together with the solution method. The system of interest is the power grid with all the stochastic and nonlinear phenomena present in it. The input to the system is the current signals (one current in the single phase case and three in the three phase setup), which are naturally constrained by the available energy of the household - stored in a battery pack or momentarily generated by the wind or solar generator unit. The response of the system can be either the current or the voltage measured at the connection point of the inverter unit, however, the general legal regulations only allow voltage measurement for consumers. The difficulty of the control problem comes from the fact, that there are no mathematically tractable models of the network can be generated because of its unpredictable and nonlinear features. This means, that only black-box methods can be applied for this system.
%
%    For the control aim it is a natural choice to minimize the actual voltage unbalance of the low voltage local transformer area measured (or calculated) at the connection point of the inverter. Several optimization based methods are available for such kind of optimal control problems, e.g.  \cite{gorbe2012reduction} where the only bottleneck is the computational efficiency since the impemented controller has to run on the commercial inverter's hardware (digital singal processor unit).

%        The renewable energy injection is realized increasingly directly to the three phase low voltage grid in domestic size photovoltaic power plants too. This can reduce the voltage and current unbalance caused by the stochastic power production of wind and solar sources. More and more manufacturers produce three phase grid synchronized inverters from 5\,kW size. These equipments implement accurate symmetrical current feed with a standard three phase full bridge structure consists of six Isolated Gate Bipolar Transistors (IGBT). This is a cost effective standard structure suitable for symmetric harmonic current injection. It has limited capacities to inject not totally symmetric 3 phase current time functions, but Kirchhoff's current law permits only constant zero-sum current time functions injected with this structure. There are examples with this type of asymmetric current injections in the literature \cite{lee2010new}.}

%        This type of current injections has limited compensation capacity and this is not enough in  most asymmetric production and load cases. In our case we need more general, not specific asymmetric current waveforms, because the proposed control aim assumes the ability of injecting non zero-sum currents. This needs special inverter design structure. We need zero line connection for the differential current. One of the possible solution is to use 3 different full bridge single phase current inverters to supply each phase of low voltage transportation lines \cite{Patnaik2013topologies}. But in this case we need galvanic isolations of these single phase inverters in the output, or in the DC input size.}

But we would like to use it a complex energetic system with specific inside true DC bus system feeded from Photovoltaic panel or batteries. We have to isolate  at least 2 full bridges with two way DC-DC converters. This can complicate the physical realization but easy to simulate with two controlled power source. Other possible easy to realize solution to isolate the full bridge outputs  connected to three phase lines with isolating transformers. It is recommended for operating and electric shock protection reasons too (Figure \ref{fig:asymminvwithgalvanic transformer}).Our distant aim to compensate other operational type line failures, such zero current appearing. This isolation method doesn't allow to produce CD current components, thats why we are looking for other design. Possible elegant solution to supplement the standard three phase inverter design with a fourth half bridge for Zero line, building a specific four leg inverter design \cite{Ninad2014control}.}

%
%            The measurements took place at the Faculty's building, where a common 400\,V connection point was investigated as the behaviour of the network. The three phase 230\,V line-to-ground voltages has been transformed to 6\,V to be effectively measurable time domain with high performance NI-USB DAQ on 10\,ksample/s. Because of the limited computational capacity only a 10 second measurement was made in every hour.  The measurements then has been merged and smoothed to eliminate the inter-measurement transients.\\
%            Afterwards, the measurement data has been used as the output of a micro-grid segment of the Matlab/Simulink model, to test the controller and inverters structure's performance in quasi-realistic circumstances. The controllers performance on the simulated microgrid's network loss reduction can be observed on (Figure \ref{fig:compare_power}). The measurement output is connected to a modeled three phase load and network system, consisting of symmetrical loads and network segments between them. Further artificial load unbalance is not necessary since the network's unbalance is already present. This structure enables to show that any point the inverter is connected could serve as quality restoration such unbalance compensation at this case. Our future plan is to set up multiple devices on different connection points.

%        \label{fig:APPS}
%        \end{figure*}
%
%        The problem is that, the exact mathematical relation is nonlinear because the nonlinear, and highly time variant loads of the network, we should use a control strategy to cope this nonlinear and time variant energy system. For this purpose we chose an asynchronous parallel pattern search method (APPS) which could be able to control our scenario.  We applied a variant of the gradient method that is a first-order optimization (minimization) algorithm for a multivariate function $f(x)$. The point $x(k)$ corresponding to the local minimum can be calculated from the negative gradient $\delta f(x)$, that gives the value and direction of the corresponding step in the parameter space. The next step is made in the direction of gradient with the proper sign. This sequence of steps, ideally, converges to local multivariate extreme value $x(k)$ of the function (\ref{eqn:contstruct1}).
%
%        \begin{equation}
%        \begin{array}{rcl}
%        \label{eqn:contstruct1}
%         x^{(k)}&=&x^{(k-1)}-t_k \nabla f(x^{(k-1)})\\
%         k&\in&\mathbb{N}\\
%         \end{array}
%        \end{equation}
%
%        The controlled electrical system is described by multivariate non-linear differential equations, the optimization of which is infeasible to derive using the differentiation of an error function. Therefore, the optimization methods based on direct differentiation are not applicable. In such cases, when high computational power is needed for performing long time-consuming simulations, the APPS method can utilized. The search pattern $p$ is based on the sampling of the error function (selected norm) on a "grid", and it corresponds to variables or subsets of variables in each point in the independent variable or parameter space easily. At the same time, the norm values at these points can be calculated independently if $\Delta k>0$, using (\ref{eqn:contstruct2}).
%        \begin{equation}
%        \label{eqn:contstruct2}
%        \begin{array}{rcl}
%         x^{(k+1)}&=&x^{(k)}+\Delta _kd_i \\
%         \mathrm{if}&&f(x^{(k)}+\Delta _kd_i) \leq f(x^{(k)})\\
%         k&\in&\mathbb{N}\\
%         \end{array}
%        \end{equation}
%
%        The parameter is  $x(k)\in R_n$, and the search pattern $p\in D={d_1,...d_n}$ is taken from a predefined finite set. In this case, the error function values should be calculated for each pattern $p$ in the set $D$. If the error function is not decreasing in any of the directions, then the step size should be reduced (e.g. by half). As the competing directions are different, if there is not enough computing power available for direction vector $p$, synchronization should not be maintained. In this case we are talking about the asynchronous case . In the case of our controller, an individual $p$ vector is defined for each output variable, and the optimization was performed in each direction asynchronously and shifted in time. Most likely, the error function has a single local minimum as a symmetric amplitude and phase values. Approaching the minimal value of norm, the controller uses adaptive increments that are proportional to the norm itself. Because of the complex interactions between the components of the controller, only one parameter is changed at a time, even if the values of the amplitude and phase components in specific time slot changes. The algorithm moves along the six axes of six separate time slots close to the local minimum of the error function.\\
%        Unlike other similar approaches, e.g. \cite{segui2007approach}, the explained optimal controller does not rely on a measured current signal but rather measuring and analysing the voltage unbalance via the proposed indicator and optimizes the voltage shape, the latter of which depends on the nonlinear distortion of the whole low-voltage transformer area and determines additional power losses. The controller's performance was compared to a non compensated network, and a network consisting synchronised symmetric power intake from a regular inverter.\\
%        In each iteration only one physical value is changing on the six dimensional parameter field, which consists of the three amplitude and three phase values. If the change effects with cost function reduction (the reference norm's normalised value), the controller holds the new value of amplitude or phase for the controlled current sources. The advantage of this controller structure that is not necessary to know the controlled value's behaviour well, like we could not determine the number and type of the other loads on the network \cite{Neukirchner2015}. There are however two disadvantages. First is the low speed of control, due to the several necessary iterations (depending on the circumstances) to find the optimal directions in the parameter space, and the serial nature of interventions and norm calculations. The second comes from the method itself since the controller may stuck in local minima.

%\subsection{Discussion}
%    \subsubsection{Dynamical simulation based experiments}
%    In order to be able to investigate the proposed optimization based unbalance reduction control structure with the three phase inverter on a low voltage local grid, all the elements of this complex electrical system (including the photovoltaic source, the inverter, the battery and the nonlinear local grid with different types of loads) has been modeled in Matlab/Simulink environment. The primary aim of the simulation based experiments were to serve as a proof of concept for the proposed complex control structure.
%    \subsubsection{Performance analysis}
%    The aim of performance analysis is twofold. First of all, the proposed voltage unbalance indicator has to be investigated in the control structure as the cost function of the optimization based controller, and on the other hand, the control structure itself has to be exposed against engineering expectations.
%
%%     The first experiment is depicted in Figure \ref{fig:compare_asym_VEC}, where the vectorial based voltage unbalance indicator was used as the cost function of the optimization algorithm. The results are far not promising since the value of norm $N$ of the network starts to oscillate when the unbalance reduction controller is active. The cause of this behaviour is \textcolor{red}{WHAT?}

%
%            A slightly more challangeing situation is investigated in Figure \ref{fig:compare_asym} where the controller had had to operate without photovoltaic source and batteries. This is called zero balance operation mode when the energy obtained from the network is reinjected in such a way that the unbalance indicators decrease. It can be seen that the performance of the controller is modest than that of Figure \ref{fig:compare_asym_PV}, but it is still acceptable.

%            The robustness of the proposed control structure is an important qualitative property with respect to the time dependent loads present on the network. The robustness of the proposed controller had to be tested via simulation when different types of loads (inductive, capacitive, resistive) had been varied in step changes representing represnting the on/off switching the different types of household appliances (motors, switching mode power supplies, electric heaters, stc.). In the experiment depicted in Figure \ref{fig:robustness}, a load change has been introduced to the network in every 15 seconds causing the voltage unbalance to jump to a different value (measured in the geometrical norm (\ref{equ:geom})). As it can be seen in the figure the controller successfully compensates the unbalance after each transient.

%
%        \paragraph[CO2 footprint]{CO$_2$ footprint}
%
%            The fact that this controller enables the reactive power reduction has a favourable consequence, i.e. the power loss or equivalently CO$_2$ emission and the carbon footprint can also be decreased. The estimated environmental effects of voltage asymmetry compensation can be calculated. Let us assume 3000\,kWh for the yearly electric energy consumption an average household and $9.173\%$ for the loss of the distribution network \cite{MVM2013}. With the controller the losses on the simulated network are reduced by 6.5\%. The calculation follows (\ref{eqn:co_emission})
%
%            \begin{equation}
%                \label{eqn:co_emission}
%                \begin{array}{rcl}
%                 P_{loss}&=&3000\,\textnormal{kWh}\cdot9.173\%\\
%                P^{comp}_{loss}&=&3000\,\textnormal{kWh}\cdot(9.173\cdot0.93)\%\\
%                 \Delta P_{loss}&=&P_{loss}-P^{comp}_{loss}\\
%                 \end{array}
%                \end{equation}
%
%            where $P_{loss}$ is the assumed network loss per household and $P^{comp}_{loss}$ is s the assumed network loss with unbalance compensation control and $\Delta P_{loss}$ is the saved energy. According to (\ref{eqn:co_emission}), unbalance compensation results in an energy savings of 19.26 kWh. Taking into account the proportion of power currently generated by fossil fuels (coal 17.3\,\%, gas 38.3\% \cite{MVM2013}, \cite{gorbe2012reduction}) and the rate of $\textnormal{CO}_2$ emission during electric energy production (1,000\,g/kWh from coal and 430\,g/kWh from gas), it can be concluded that voltage unbalance compensation could reduce $\textnormal{CO}_2$ emissions by 6504.9\,g a year, in an average household. %Note that this result reflect only the proof of concept, due the neglected power losses of the inverter and the artificial load of the network.

%\subsection{Conclusion}
%
%    The currently used measures of voltage unbalance has been extended in this work with a norm candidate. It is more demanding from the computational point of view but has an interesting feature namely it checks electrical asymmetry, i.e. the norm of a $\pm120$ degree  rotated version of the ideal three-phase phasor is zero in the geometrical sense.\\
%    The defined norm is applied as a cost function in the asymmetry reducing controller structure also presented in the paper. Simulations show that the geometrical based unbalance indicator can serve as a basis of further research. The suggested controller structure enables the residential users owning a grid synchronized domestic power plant to reduce voltage unbalance measurable at the connection point. The fundamental element of the system is a modified three phase inverter that is capable of the asymmetric injection of any current waveforms to the network. The optimization based control algorithm injects the available energy (as current waveform) in such a way, that the voltage unbalance decreases. This optimization problem is usually constrained by the available renewable energy supplied by the power plant.\\
%    The control structure has been tested on a low voltage network model in a dynamical simulation environment consisting of the models of the electrical grid, a domestic power plant,  asymmetrical inverter circuit, and different types of loads. Different simulation experiments has been run for each norm and for both the power constrained and unconstrained case. The preliminary results show that this structure can serve as a residential level voltage quality improvement method for the three phase low voltage network.
